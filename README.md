# Crypto Analytics Dashboard

There are two applications that analyze the risk/return profile of various crypto assets and make price predictions using machine learning.

The first application is called "crypto_analytics dashboard.ipynb." It can be accessed over the internet through the below link or downloaded as a Jupyter Notebook for customization.

The second application is "crypto_streamlit_app.py," which is an interactive web-based application that responds to user inputs.

## Technologies

```python
The program uses Pandas, NumPy, FinancialAnalysis, Messari, Scikit-learn, hvPlot, Matplotlib, and sevaral custom built functions. 
```

## Installation Guide

FinancialAnalysis and Messari.Messari will need to be installed to customize the application in Jupyter Notebook. There are four modules in the "formulas" folder that are also required to run the file locally. Accessing the web-applications requires no programming or downloads.

## Analytics & Insights

* Historical Price Performance
* Risk/Return Metrics
* Asset Correlations
* Linear Regressions

## License

Anyone can utilize the application. However, the Jupyter Notebook requires a private key to access the data from the Messari API.
